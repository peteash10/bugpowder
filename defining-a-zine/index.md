# Defining a zine

*(This is a live document - I'll be revising it over time as my thoughts organise and develop.)*

One of the challenges of scanning and indexing a zine archive is the edge cases. Most of the zines are clearly zines. And most of the things that aren't zines are clearly not zines. But then there's the stuff that is but also isn't, or isn't but also is. Should they be included? 

Zines emerged over time thanks to increased accessibility of reproduction technologies, most significantly but not exclusively the photocopier. Like most emerging things the terminology came later in retrospect. 

## More than a fanzine

A simple etomology would be *magazines*, then *fan magazines*, then *fanzines*, then *zines*. But fanzine has a quite specific meaning - a magazine made by fans of a thing. This is quite reductive. Many of the zines in my collection are not about a thing written by a fan of that thing. Many are things in themselves. A poetry zine that contains only poetry (and no articles written by people who love poetry) is still a zine, no? 

So while a significany number of zines are fanzines the term zine is not usefully a contraction of fanzine. 

## Are zines magazines?

Physically, yes. They tend to be pieces of printed paper bound together to create a readable publication. But a magzine (when it's not being used to store ammunition for a weapon) is a periodical publication with issues coming out in sequence. Not all zines are periodical and not all are numbered. Some are stand alone entities, like books.

## Are zines books? 

Yes? But then what is a book, exactly? I worked in a bookshop for a while and the definition of a book is broad as all hell, mostly coming down to anything distributed with an ISBN, and you can put an ISBN on pretty much any printed object - maps, posters, pamphlets - and much else besides. A tiny number of items in my collection have ISBNs, because the creator decided to buy a range of numbers so they could be disributed in bookshops. 

Physically we think of *books* as having a significany number of pages bound with a spine which bears the title of the publication. Not many of my zines meet that criteria but some do. 

But the books definition collapses when you reverse it. The vast majority of books are not by any definition zines because they are published by publishers, not individuals. 

## Are zines self-published? 

This is getting closer to my preferred definition. A zine is a publication that is *not* published by a company. Mostly they are made by individuals, but often groups of people come together to make zines. When this happens they may call themselves a press or a publisher, because they are, and publish under a brand name, but this will be distinct from a commercial publisher. 

Or will it? This is one of the tricky lines to draw. Conde Naste is clearly not a publisher of zines. Some kid photocopying 50 copies is clearly a publisher of zines. But what about publishers than emerged from zines? The first issue of [Escape](https://archive.org/details/escapemagazineuk), which came directly from the 80s UK comics zine communities, is probably a zine. The last few issues were definitely not zines. Was Slab-o-Concrete publishing zines? When Pete Pavement first used the name he certainly was, but by the end he was an indie book publisher. Spiritually all his books were zines, but should we include them in a zine archive? To do so feels like it opens the floodgates in a not-useful manner. 

This happens a lot with the US mini-comics scene. Zines in the US had much wider audiences than in the UK and so could scale up to fairly decent print runs. Meanwhile indie comics from the likes of Fantagraphics and Drawn & Quarterly were printing similar numbers for the bulk of their lines. From my perspective as a comic shop customer the latest issue of [Eightball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightball_(comics)) or [Palookaville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palookaville_(comics)) was clarly not a zine, but [Factsheet Five](https://archive.org/search?query=factsheet+five) would review them alongside all the other zines because outside of the myopic comics scenes they were spiritially and economically on a par. 

And then there's the people who moved to an indie publisher. Wither Jessica Able's Artbabe, a self published comic that was picked up by Fantagraphics. Should I only include the issues she self-published, even if there's no substantial difference between them and the ones from Fantagraphics?

## Are zines a business model? 

Or maybe an anti-business model? Traditionaly in publishing you make something and someone with financial capital offers to publish it on your behalf, taking the risk in return for some of the rewards. They might be a transnational corporation, they might be your Uncle Bill, but they are not you. 

I would say a zine bypasses this. The photocopier allows for an early type of print-on-demand, reducing the initial financial outlay. Orders come in direct from readers and the postal service was shockingly affordable by todays standards. For the cost of a few beers you could run off 20 copies of your zine and send a few out to review zines, waiting for the orders to trickle in. If you were running a periodical you could offer pre-orders or subscritions to cover the next issue's costs. I never made a profit from my zines but I never really lost money either.

Zines enables communication between individuals and within communities using publishing without capital investment. 

## Are zines uncommercial? 

A common criticism of material published in a zine is it can't be any good because if it was it'd published by a proper publisher. And in many cases this is fair. The vast majority of zines are, by most critical standards, not very good. In many cases this was the point - everoyne's first zine is crap, because you have to start somewhere. But your second one is better, and the third better still. If you stick with it you might even become "good". 

And so, in comics at least, a lot of publishers would keep an eye on zines to see who was developing into a commercially viable talent. My old chum [Frazer Irving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frazer_Irving) ironed out the creases in his work in zines and then one day we were looking through his portfolio and realised he was ready for the big time. The next year he was earnbing a living working for 2000AD. 

But uncommercial is abou more than quality. Someone can be of the highest quality but not be commerically viable, and I would argue many of the best zines come into this category.
