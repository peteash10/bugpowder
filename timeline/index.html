    <p>Going through these boxes of zines twenty years after I drew a line on my activity has dug up a load of memories and a realisation that my mind often had stuff in the wrong order. This timeline is to help me get stuff straight, but also should contextualise and explain the nature of the collection and how it came to be.</p>

<p>As always, this is an incomplete document which will be continuously updated and revised as I pull zines out of the boxes which unearth events long forgotten.</p>

<p><em>Last updated 18 Aug 24</em></p>

<h2 id="1987">1987</h2>

<p>I’m 13 going on 14 and a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_AD_(comics)">2000AD</a> catches my eye in the WH Smiths on West Wickham high street. I must have told my school friend Lawford because he then got me proper into comics. He’s long been into DC superheroes, so he lends me lent a bunch of those, but he was also getting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Luther_Arkwright">Bryan Talbot’s Adventures of Luther Arkwright</a> which was being serialised by Valkyrie Press. This was an independently published black and white comic and like nothing I had ever seen before. He also pointed me towards the Alan Moore-led “mature readers” comics DC was putting out and the first American comic I <em>think</em> I bought with my own money was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a>.</p>

<p>Our local comic shop was Phantom Zone in Croydon where I picked up a copy of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/fanscene/s-z/speakeasy-41-80">Speakeasy</a>, a fanzine which had professionalised into the main source of information for British fans. I think it was issue 74. I didn’t know it was a fanzine - I valued it for the listings of what was coming up in 2000AD. Eventually the rest of the contents became of interest to me too.</p>

<h2 id="1988">1988</h2>

<p>I am 14 going on 15 and my friend Phil is into fantasy roleplaying. I’m more into comics but there’s enough of an overlap so he gets a bit into comics while I join him at the gaming club. Phil is buying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GM_(magazine)">GM Magazine</a> which has a couple of pages of zine reviews. I’m intrigued by the concept and send off for a few. <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100077/">Vollmond</a> was a classic zine with all the requisite features, while <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100044/">Fat Knite</a> had more comics and appealed to my juvenile sense of humour. There were others but what I saw in those two probably influenced the direction my life would take more than any other piece of media. (<a href="https://archive.org/details/gmvolume-1-no-7">Issue 7 of GM is on Internet Archive.</a> It’s not the specific issue that changed my life but it has that zine reviews page.)</p>

<p><a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100077/"><img src="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/images/covers/100077_c.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I went to UKCAC, the main (only?) British comics convention. As a pretty solid comics fan by this stage I’d been going to signings at the various comic shops in London and spent the weekend collecting sketches and signatures. I was very indiscriminate, asking anyone with a guest badge for their scribble, regardless of who they were. My convention booklet wound up smothered in scribbles.</p>

<p>[scan to come]</p>

<p>1988 was a banner year for British comics. Possibly the biggest influence for me was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_(magazine)">Deadline</a> which launched at UKCAC. Editors Steve Dillon and Brett Ewins were both 2000AD veterans, which gave me an in, and the ziney, counterculture vibe showed some interesting possibilities.</p>

<p>Also the owners of my local comic shop, Phantom Zone, publishes their own comics anthology, <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100590/">HB</a>.</p>

<p>I decide I’m going to do my own zine. I name it PDS after a band my mate Barry had started and swiftly abandoned as I liked the name. It never stood for anything, and I liked that too.</p>

<h2 id="1989">1989</h2>

<p>Over the start of the year I work on my new zine, PDS. It hasn’t come up for scanning yet but I know there’s a copy  in there somewhere. It was a mix of role-playing games and comics, not unlike Fat Knite. It was not very good but that was OK. First zines are never any good.</p>

<p>That summer I was staying with my dad who’d been living the USA for the last decade after a pretty messy divorce and had recently gotten back in touch. I was spending time in his office which had a photocopier which I used to run off a few copies, albeit on that weird paper size they have there.</p>

<p>That September I took my first zine to UKCAC 89. I might even have hired a table to sell it from? That sounds right but I have no record other than a demonstrably faulty memory. Yes, I’m pretty sure I paid for a table in the zine section of the hall and me and my mates used it as our base for the weekend. Christ, I’d forgotten all about that.</p>

<p>It does explain how Philip Bond came to buy a copy. That I do remember.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, there was a Neil Gaiman interview in that first issue. He was signing copies of Black Orchid at Phantom Zone and the owners arranged for me and Phil to interview him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/PeteAshtonNeilGaiman">I kept the tape and uploaded it to Archive.org a while back.</a> Except that throws another spanner in the works as the recording is dated September 1989, which is too late.</p>

<p>Gah.</p>

<p>I’ll revisit this when I actually find the bloody thing.</p>

<h2 id="1990">1990</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Since last September I’ve been living with my mum in Winchester and going to 6th form where I meet Dave Early who can draw a mean Judge Dredd. We become friends.</li>
  <li><a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100018/">Atomic</a>, <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100868/">Inkling</a> and <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100430/">Nightfall</a> anthologies probably bought at UKCAC and I get a sense of what’s out there.</li>
  <li>I decide to relaunch <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100616/">PDS</a> as a comic anthology. First issue a bit ropey, of course.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1991">1991</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I finish 6th form with no qualifications and get odd jobs, winding up in a bookshop.</li>
  <li>I publish PDS v2 issues <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100669/">2</a>, <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100670/">3</a> and <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100617/">4</a> and they’re not that bad really.</li>
  <li>Met Rik Hoskin and fall in with the scene around his Defective Comics comics.</li>
  <li>Went to a small press comics gathering in Reading.</li>
  <li>Find a copy of Savoy’s <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100638/">Lord Horror</a> in the back of a comic shop.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1992">1992</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I move to Eastleigh, near Southampton, and continue working for Dillons bookshop. Fall in with some hairy bikers for a few years and learn about community and stuff.</li>
  <li>I think the zines take a bit of back seat for a while.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1993">1993</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Small press comics peer group expands to the community around Rol Hirst’s <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100267/">The Jock</a> and other “indie” style publications.</li>
  <li>Get copies of <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100472/">Battleground 3</a> and <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100529/">Zum 6</a> which open up doors to whole new communities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1994">1994</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Quit the bookshop to do an Access to Higher Education course at the local college so I could go to University (no A-levels, remember).</li>
  <li>Was frequenting a comic shop in Southampton managed by <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100079/">Paul Davies</a> who pushes a lot of interesting indie stuff on me like Paul Pope’s self-published <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THB_(comics)">THB</a></em>.</li>
  <li>Was sending letters and the occasional article to zines like Caption and Battleground. Having been failed by school thanks to undiagnosed autism (it was the 80s…) this was pretty much where I taught myself to write.</li>
  <li>I’m not sure which was my first Caption convention in Oxford but this would be the earliest possible year.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1995">1995</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Decide to start a comics discussion zine like Battleground. As I send out a flyer asking for contributions, Andy Brewer announces he’s ending Battleground. <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100470/">Vicious</a>, my new zine, mops up a portion of his audience. I published three issues. (The name came from the Lou Reed song for no reason.)</li>
  <li>Because I want Vicious to be contributor-run and have no editorial control (I published everything I was sent) I wanted to keep the reviews separate, so I included an insert sheet called The Review Sheet or <strong>TRS</strong>. This soon became an autonomous thing where I would send other zinesters bundles to distribute with their mailouts, getting the reviews out to hundreds of people.</li>
  <li>Annoyingly I kept no copies of TRS and the disks have long been lost. If you have any please send me a scan or photo!</li>
  <li>Completed the Access course and was accepted to Birmingham University to study Philosophy. Moved there in September.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1996">1996</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Published two more issues of Vicious and take them to UKCAC.</li>
  <li>At some point prior to this had become friends with Jez Higgins who was living in Coventry and eventually moved to Birmingham. With some others we started the Birmingham Comics Pub Meet which aimed to recreate the UKCAC bar each month. It ran for a good decade.</li>
  <li>This year’s is the earliest <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100828/">Caption convention programme</a> I have in the collection, so might be my first attendance. I’m pretty sure I was there the year before though.</li>
  <li>TRS is getting distributed far and wide and I start getting send zines from abroad for review.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1997">1997</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The Birmingham comics gang hire a bunch of tables at UKCAC and set up a base-camp there, anchored by the sixth and final issue of Vicious and the <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100460/">Jack Kirby Quarterly</a> with everyone else’s comics and zines in-between.</li>
  <li>This year’s UKCAC was pretty gonzo for me. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010228090638/http://bugpowder.com/ukcac.html">I wrote a rambling report of the wild times.</a> Living the dream.</li>
  <li>Around this time I decide to start a mail order service for zines and comics. I call it BugPowder Dustribution for stupid reasons. (I’d been given a club flyer using comics imagery and reasoned if music was going to rip off comics I’d do the same back and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_Powder_Dust">Bomb the Bass</a> must have come on the radio. The <em>Naked Lunch</em> reference was nicely underground, but mostly it was a stupid joke I ran with. I have never been good a naming things…)</li>
  <li>Co-incidentally Pete Pavement has decided to stop running <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100857/">the distro side of Slab-o-Concrete</a> and just focus on publishing. I mop up a portion of his business. Yes, that’s a pattern.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/andyluke/347838236/in/pool-captioncomicsconvention/"><img src="/images/bugpowder_stall_caption.jpg" alt="" /></a> <br />
<em>This photo of the BugPowder stall at Caption taken by Andy Luke says it was in 1997 but the Hey Mister book on display wasn’t published til 1998, which seems more likely to be honest. Might even have been Caption99.</em></p>

<h2 id="1998">1998</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I’m flailing and failing at University, academia and me failing to get on once again (autism still not diagnosed - it’ll be another two decades before than happens) but on the plus side I’ve been building up <a href="https://bugpowder.peteashton.com/z/100615/">a fairly substantial mail order service</a> for comics and zines from my student house while working at a copy shop on campus. So things could be worse?</li>
  <li>I’m taking suitcases of zines on trains to conventions and zine fairs across the country and making a pretty good turnover. Never a profit, but that’s not the point.</li>
  <li>I leave Uni with no degree and get a job at the big Dillons in Birmingham (now the Apple store).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1999">1999</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I’m a full-on bookseller now and while I’m still running BugPowder and doing the occasional stall I’m starting to pull away from the scene. There’s a marked dip in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTrnKQwETHzJO6yjRxApwnhg-3YDlPZtRe7tNGySlMr_oOgLzX6rjShSduzq1MprZHocjUgMcs0Qrvn/pubchart?oid=864147397&amp;format=image">zines by year graph</a> at this point.</li>
  <li>Jez, a computing engineer by trade, shows me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot">Slashdot</a> and introduces me to the concept of weblogs. He also get the bugpowder.com address and I start putting together <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000520014218/http://www.bugpowder.com/">a rudimentary online catalogue</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2000">2000</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I move to London with my them girlfriend. London is where all the comics action is and I’m keen to get involved again. I make contact with <a href="http://www.paulgravett.com/">Paul Gravett</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Art_Trust">Cartoon Art Trust</a> and have big plans. Sadly the nature of living and working in London means I have no time to actually do any of them. Things were much easier in Birmingham. Still, lots of talking even if not much action.</li>
  <li>I start blogging.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2001">2001</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There’s a spike in the number of zines in the archive from this year and I don’t know why. I’m not doing reviews (Jez and Andy Luke have taken that on) and I’m not running the distro. My memory is my focus is more on blogging these days, but maybe it wasn’t? More research needed.</li>
  <li>The BugPowder.com blog is pretty active around this time. I have no real memory of what was going on there but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010401000000*/https://www.bugpowder.com/">it should be all on archive.org</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2002---2003">2002 - 2003</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I think I’m pretty much an elder on the scene now with most additions to the archive coming from my own purchases.</li>
  <li>In 2003 I leave London, work on a farm on the Isle of Wight for the summer and eventually move back to Birmingham in the autumn where I’ve lived ever since.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2004-onwards">2004 onwards</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I’m basically a blogger now, blogging about my weird temp jobs and local gigs in Birmingham. I’m convinced blogging is a natural evolution of zines - people publishing on a network. Not many of the my 90s zine people seem to have followed though.</li>
  <li>I go to Caption for a couple more years pick up zines here and there, but I draw a line on getting involved with the scene. I stay in touch with some of the good friends I’ve made over the years and occasionally wonder what’s up with the others.</li>
  <li>And every time I move house (which I do a lot until settling down in 2010) I have these bloody boxes of zines with me…</li>
