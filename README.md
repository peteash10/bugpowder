# The BugPowder archive

From 1988 to the early 2000s I amassed a collection of thousands of self published comics and zines, mostly from the UK small press comics scenes but also from across the world covering all manner of subjects. I ran a review zine, TRS, and a mail order distro, BugPowder, which meant people sent me unsolicited copies of their zines for review or sale. I drifted away from the scene from around 2003 but kept all the zines in boxes. 

In 2024, while signed off work with Long-Covid-related stuff, I decided to start scanning them, opening the first box and starting from the top. This page shows my progress.

At some point in 2025 I will have scanned all the smaller zines and will need to get an A3 scanner. If you can advise me on which to buy and where to get one from at a reasonable price, or have one I could buy/borrow, please get in touch!

## The scanned zines

As the scanning progresses I'm updating a spreadsheet on Google docs. 

- [List of scanned zines as a web page.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTrnKQwETHzJO6yjRxApwnhg-3YDlPZtRe7tNGySlMr_oOgLzX6rjShSduzq1MprZHocjUgMcs0Qrvn/pubhtml?gid=1433529062&single=true)

I plan to turn this into a more accessible, searchable website in the future.

This page was updated on **22 July 2024** and scanning began on **6 June 2024**.  In that time **175 zines** have been scanned, an average of **3.8 per day**. 

When stacked as an A4 pile the scanned zines are **152 mm high**.   The total height of all the zines in A4 boxes is **3,602 mm**, so we are **4.21%** of the way through the scanning. **0.61** of the 16 boxes have been scanned.   

The 175 scanned zines comprise **4,866** pages, an average of **27.8** pages per zine. The largest zine has **92** pages and the smallest **2**. The most common size is **24** pages.

The uncompressed TIFF files take up **41.4 GB** on disk and the estimated final total is **984.2 GB**.   

Based on the current rate, the final day of scanning should be **4 June 2027**, which is in **34.45** months.
