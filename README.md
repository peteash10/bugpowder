# The BugPowder archive

From 1988 to the early 2000s I amassed a collection of thousands of self published comics and zines, mostly from the UK small press comics scenes but also from across the world covering all manner of subjects. I ran a review zine, TRS, and a mail order distro, BugPowder, which meant people sent me unsolicited copies of their zines for review or sale. I drifted away from the scene from around 2003 but kept all the zines in boxes. 

In 2024, while signed off work with Long-Covid-related stuff, I decided to start scanning them, opening the first box and starting from the top. This page shows my progress.

In a few months I will need an A3 scanner. If you can advise me on which to buy and where to get one from at a reasonable price, or have one I could buy/borrow, please get in touch!

## The scanned zines

As the scanning progresses I'm updating a spreadsheet on Google docs. I plan to turn this into a more accessible, searchable website in the future.
