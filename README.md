# The BugPowder archive

From 1988 to the early 2000s I amassed a collection of thousands of self published comics and zines, mostly from the UK small press comics scenes but also from across the world covering all manner of subjects. I ran a review zine, TRS, and a mail order distro, BugPowder, which meant people sent me unsolicited copies of their zines for review or sale. I drifted away from the scene from around 2003 but kept all the zines in boxes. 

In 2024, while signed off work with Long-Covid-related stuff, I decided to start scanning them, opening the first box of A5 zines and scanning a handful each evening. This page documents my progress.

At some point in 2025 I will have scanned all the smaller zines and will need to get an A3 scanner to do the rest. If you can advise me on which to buy and where to get one from at a reasonable price, or have one I could buy/borrow, please get in touch!

As the scanning progresses I'm updating a spreadsheet on Google docs. 

- [List of scanned zines as a web page.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTrnKQwETHzJO6yjRxApwnhg-3YDlPZtRe7tNGySlMr_oOgLzX6rjShSduzq1MprZHocjUgMcs0Qrvn/pubhtml?gid=1433529062&single=true)

I plan to turn this into a more accessible, searchable website in the future.

## Stats

Scanning is **4.6%** complete <br>
☑️☑️☑️☑️🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲🔲

This page was updated on **24 July 2024** and scanning began on **6 June 2024**.  Over those 48 days **185 zines** have been scanned, an average of **3.9 per day**. 

When stacked as an A4 pile the scanned zines are **165 mm high**.   The total height of all the zines in A4 boxes is **3,602 mm**, so we are **4.6%** of the way through the scanning. **0.66** of the 16 boxes have been scanned. *(A small but significant number of items may not technically be zines or self published, so the total height will shrink once I make some hard decisions.)*

The 185 scanned zines comprise **5,166** pages, an average of **27.9** pages per zine. The largest zine has **92** pages and the smallest **2**. Of the scanned zines, the earliest were published in **1988** and the latest in **2005**.

The uncompressed TIFF files take up **44.3 GB** on disk. If we are 4.6% complete, the final total should be **966.5 GB**.   

At the current rate the final day of scanning should be **19 April 2027**, which is in **32.88** months.   

## Progress by format

A4 / letter | 1,605mm | 1mm | 0.06%
Comic book | 1,090mm | 0mm | 0.00%
