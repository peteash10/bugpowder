# The BugPowder archive

From 1988 to the early 2000s I amassed a collection of thousands of self published comics and zines, mostly from the UK small press comics scenes but also from across the world covering all manner of subjects. I ran a review zine, TRS, and a mail order distro, BugPowder, which meant people sent me unsolicited copies of their zines for review or sale. I drifted away from the scene from around 2003 but kept all the zines in boxes. 

In 2024, while signed off work with Long-Covid-related stuff, I decided to start scanning them, opening the first box and starting from the top. This page shows my progress.

In a few months I will need an A3 scanner. If you can advise me on which to buy and where to get one from at a reasonable price, or have one I could buy/borrow, please get in touch!

## Info
- [Scanning the BugPowder zine archive](https://72.peteashton.com/scanning-the-bugpowder-archive/) - blog post introducing the project, 25 June 2024.
- [The Open Zine Archive](https://art.peteashton.com/OZA/) - the collection on display in 2018.

## Stats
Progress is measured by taking the physical height of the scanned zines vs the total height all the zines, converted to A4. (A5 height divided by 2, A6 by 4, and US comic format multiplied by 0.71.)

I use this percentage to estimate the total file size and the date of the final scan. 
  
- Date of first scan: 	6Â JuneÂ 2024	
- This page updated: 	20Â JulyÂ 2024

- Total height of zines:	3,602	mm
- Estimated total filesize	986.54	GB
- Boxes scanned:	0.53	/ 16
- **Estimated day of final scan:**	10Â DecemberÂ 2026

## The zines

As the scanning progresses I'm updating a spreadsheet on Google docs. I plan to turn this into a more accessible, searchable website in the future.
